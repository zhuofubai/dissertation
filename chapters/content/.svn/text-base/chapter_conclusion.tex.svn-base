\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chp:conclusion}

This dissertation presents a novel method of ontology-driven data integration for clinical research.  The contributions of Physio-MIMI in clinical data integration are as follow: First, a unified schema is developed to integrate a sleep domain ontology, created using a ontology segmentation algorithm, and a units ontology to clinical research data sources using an intuitive Data Source to Ontology Mapper. Second, a usable web-interface called VISAGE is created to support research hypothesis generation and validation, and patient case-control population identification through the use of ontology-driven querying interface. Finally, using agile software development methodology, a fully functional and user-friendly web-interface is created to facilitate multi-site collaboration, and cross-institution data integration through the use of fine-grained data access control mechanisms.

Physio-MIMI is a ground-breaking clinical data integration system through the use of an integrated sleep domain ontology.  The Comparative Outcomes Management with Electronic Data Technology (COMET) project funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is using Physio-MIMI as a framework to provide further research in data integration and clinical studies.  COMET focuses on comparative effectiveness trials for female patients with \emph{Obstructive Sleep Apnea}, along with developing and infrastructure for querying data for longitudinal studies.

In future work, first, we plan on addressing ontology concepts that have varying definitions across institutions.  We plan on addressing the complex structure provided by terms such as \emph{Apnea Hypopnea Index}.  These terms are multi-variate and contain multiple definitions.  In order to address these issues, we plan on expanding the sleep domain ontology to more adequately represent the terms in a form that can be translated to the VISAGE interface.  The ontology will be changed to handle this new type of relationship between a concept and its variables by extending the formula property provided in this dissertation.  The relationship will be expanded to provide multiple formulae, each with specific properties such as variable inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Within the VISAGE interface, this process will be made transparent to the end-user by providing the researcher a well-defined representation of the ontology concept based on the formula specified by the specific institution.  VISAGE will also provide the researcher a method to dynamically query on such concepts as \emph{Apnea Hypopnea Index}, which can be formulated in a variety of manners, by providing dynamic construction through the use of researcher specified formulae and inclusion or exclusion of specific properties within the variable.

Second, we plan on addressing the scalability of the sleep domain ontology by creating anchors within the ontology to filter and group the ontology in order to present the researcher with the portion in which he is interested.  These anchors serve various purposes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Gives the \emph{Domain Expert} control of how the ontology is displayed without having to modify the original OWL ontology.
  \item Allows the \emph{Domain Expert} to assign specific researcher roles to the anchor by domain.
  \item Allows the \emph{Domain Expert} to organize the ontology for use in the Query Builder.
\end{itemize}

Finally, we plan on extending the querying capabilities of Physio-MIMI by allowing researchers to query binary data that is stored in varying formats within the system.  For example, a researcher will be able to define a query that gathers the number of events during \emph{REM Sleep} from a polysomnogram stored in the underlying data source.  This extension will require modification to the query process since a query may return immediately or require hours of background processing if results are not currently cached.  Physio-MIMI will also be redesigned to support modular components for analysis of binary data.  These modular components will consist of data-wrappers that provide information on an underlying collection of binary files.  This extension will increase the amount of data types that can be supported via Physio-MIMI and will greatly increase a researcher's experience using Physio-MIMI.
